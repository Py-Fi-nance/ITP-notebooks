    "## **The Three Elements of Logical Operations**\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have discussed, Python is the language-like interface of a logical operation processing machine. The purpose of this class is to teach you the basics of using this interface to operate that machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before a logical operation can be processed, it must first be defined. This is the work of programming - writing computer code <ins>is</ins> defining logical operations to be processed. Therefore, as you learn about the elements of Python, it will be useful for you to keep in mind the elements of a logical operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logical operations are composed of *operands* and *operators* (with the possible addition of *grouping symbols*). Operands represent inputs subjected to transformation, and operators represent kinds of transformations. Consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "`2 + 4`\n",
    "\n",
    "This arithmetic operation (which is one kind of logical operation) begins with a value of `2`. Then, the `+` operator determines the kind of transformation (addition) which is applied to the `2`, and the `4` indicates the magnitude of the transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logical operations are processed in a conventional order. Consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "`2 + 4 / 6`\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the conventional order of operations directs us to divide `4` by `6` before adding the result to `2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grouping symbols modify the order of operations. Consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "`(2 + 4) / 6`\n",
    "\n",
    "This example contains the same operands and operators as the prior example, but the parentheses change the order in which the operation is processed, producing a different result.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python programming language allows you to define logical operations that are much more complex than these examples. However, it seems to me that every executable part of Python - maybe any computer programming language - aims to define an operand, an operator, or the right order of operations. I expect that keeping these three categories in mind will help you to mentally organize and remember Python's many parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a relatively new idea for me and the first time I am sharing it in a class, so if you spot an exception, please let me know so that I can refine my understanding."
